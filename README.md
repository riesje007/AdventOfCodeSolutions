## Welcome
Hi. 

Here you can find the solutions that I programmed to solve the puzzles of [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

This doesn't mean they are the best way to solve them, there might be better or more effective ways.
But you could use these to get hints on how you could solve a puzzle like that or maybe it could inspire you to draft somehting of your own.

I have used C++ in combination with visual studio 2019 to solve the puzzles. Hence you will find the source inside each folder is written in C++.
The code is not specific to any platform. I am using STL, not Microsoft or any vendor specific library.

Each source file, when imported in an empty C++ project in visual studio on windows, will open a command shell when compiled and run.

This box will be empty and a blinking cursor shows it is waiting for input. 
Here you can paste the input that is given at the puzzle.

To stop pasting input, on a new line just type "stop" and press enter (unless specified otherwise in the specific readme of that day). The line "stop" will not be processed as input, but all previous lines are considered input to the puzzle.

The program will then process the input and output a message that contains the answer you are looking for.

>**_Note:_**  
Most of the code is not very efficient, as it was attempted to create a solution quickly, without optimizing te code. Also, different variable naming styles can be observed throughout the code as I was not sticking to any standards (normally I do stick to such standards).
