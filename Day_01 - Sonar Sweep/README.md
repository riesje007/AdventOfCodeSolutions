# Solution
The source.cpp file contains the c++ code that tackles the problem.
This program processes input a little differently.
If you want to end your input, then on a new line enter the value '-1' (or some other negative value) and press enter.  
Do not enter "stop", because it will crash the program (there is no error checking and the input expects numbers).

This source tackles the second part of the puzzle, but should also be usable for the first part.
