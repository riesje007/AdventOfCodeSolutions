### Keep track of the depth and position of the submarine

Pretty straightforward adding the amount of down to the depth and subtracting the amount of up from the depth while adding amounts of forward to the position variable.

## Part 1: 
Using `cin` you can read multiple types of input in one go, so read the action, then read the amount.  
Normally I don't include error checking in a code challenge, because I want a solution quickly, but here I did add one check (line `27`) to see if I did not miss anything unexpected in the input (not feeling at home yet in this code challenge environment ;)

## Part 2:
As in part 1, but now accounting for `aim`.  
This code file hardly differs form the code file in part 1.  
Spot the difference already? Take a look at lines `17` and `21` in the code file of part 2.
